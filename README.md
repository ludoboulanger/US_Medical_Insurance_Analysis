# US Medical Analysis

This is a project I did for the Codecademy Data Scientist Carreer Path. The main goal of this project was to put basic Python programming skills to the test with real world data.

The subject of analysis for this project was to find out how much the health of a person impacted the general yearly medical insurance costs.

The whole project is done in a jupyter notebook which gives the scope, the code, the results, the discussion on these results and finishes off wiht a conclusion
