    "## Project Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this project is to analyze each category impacts the cost of health insurance in the goal to develop machine learning models able to predict how much impact a certain characteristic will have on the individual's medical insurance cost. This way, insurance companies will be able to maximise profit and be more competitive in the market when they are trying to sell insurance to individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously the goal mentioned above is out of scope considering the limitations of the data at hand and the amount of data at our disposal. However it is a good situation to aim for when analyszing the data and it will be used to orient the rest of this project. The specific scope of this project, however, is to analyze the impact of each category in the dataset on the yearly medical insurance cost of an individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used for this project is the data given by codecademy on the US medical insurance cost. The data has over 1000 records of different individuals, their characteristics and their insurance cost. The data is already cleaned and it is in csv format. No records are missing and no data is wierdly formatted.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this analysis, all the columns will be used to get a better understanding of their impact on the cost of medical insurance. A more detail explanation of each column can be found below.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **age**: The age of the individual in years\n",
    "- **sex**: The sex of the individual. For now, their is only male or female in the dataset\n",
    "- **bmi**: The bmi for the individual. The data is in float format. In other words, it is not a categorical column *\n",
    "- **smoker**: An indication of the smoker status of the individual. either 'yes' or 'no'\n",
    "- **region**: The region where the person lives\n",
    "- **charges**: The cost that the indivudal pays for insurance **\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\\* Due to the limitations of data, it is impossible to know the units of measurement for this property. It is known though, that the bmi si the ratio of the person's weight and the square of it's height. The universal way to calculate it is with the  weight in `kg` and the height in `m` [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index)\n",
    "\n",
    "\\*\\* The units of charges is unknown. Considering the data is from the US, the units of measurements is probably USD. However, according to [Registered nursing.org](https://www.registerednursing.org/healthcare-costs-by-age/), The yearly spendings of Arerican citizens is in the throusands and grows with age. This is very similar to the data we have. Knowing this, it is possible to assume that the charges are calculated yearly and in USD\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The type of analysis would be to optimize the cost of insurance companies to help them stay competitive in the market while maximizing their profit in their sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, like mentioned in the goal section, this project will limit itself to the analysis of the data currently at hand. With that in mind, the analysis will be more of a descriptive analysis because the goal is to describe the impact of each factor on the medical insurance of individuals."

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sub-sections, I discuss the results obtained in the [Results](#Results) section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sex Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the results for sex, it is possible to infer that male individuals are likely to pay more insurance yearly than female individuals. In fact, it was found that males pay, on average, around 14 000 USD yearly, while females are close behind at around 12 500 USD on average. This is an unexpected results as, usually, women have to pay more for medical insurance. In fact according to [this article](https://www.registerednursing.org/healthcare-costs-by-age/), woman pay around 1/3 more insurance than males yearly on average. This is due in general, to their higher life expectancy (Women tend to live two years more than men) and to childbirth expenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "What could explain the difference in the obtained results versus the ones found by the *US Department of Health & Human Services* is the fact that our sample size is not very representative of the US population. In fact, our sample only has around 1000 records.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Smoker Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The results for the smoker category were expected. In fact, smokers do pay more medical insurance because they need more care in general and they are less healthy that non-smokers. These factors contribute to the overall increase of medical insurance. This is called *Tobacco Rating*\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, for the smoker category, there are approximately 5 times more non-smokers in the dataset  than there are smokers. This means that there is a lot more data on non-smokers than smokers resulting in the results for non-smokers being more representative of the non-smoker population than the results for non-smokers. However, taking this into consideration, according to [this article](https://news.gallup.com/poll/109048/us-smoking-rate-still-coming-down.aspx), the ratio of adult smokers to adult non-smokers is about 1 for 5. Which represents the ratio of the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "### Region Results\n",
    "\n",
    "For the regions, there isn't much fluctuation between them. However, there is a small difference between the east and the west regions. It looks like the west is slightly less expensive than the east. For this category, there were approximately the same amount of people per region (around 300). However, that is still not a lot of records compared to the population of the United States which is around 300 million inhabitants.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Age Results\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to infer that, for age, the cost of medical insurance grows as age grows. In fact, there is a clear increase in cost of medical insurance as the individual gets older. Like for the smoker category, this is probably caused by the fact that the older an individual, the more care he or she will need.\n",
    "\n",
    "### BMI Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The BMI results are very similar to the smoker results and the age results. These three categories seem to follow a certain tendancy where the least healthy the individual, the more insurance it will need to pay. In fact, as the BMI grows, meaning a less than ideal health condition, the cost of medical insurance seems to grow also.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Number of Children Results\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of the number of children, again there is an increase in cost of medical insurance as the number of children grows. According to this [site](https://www.bcbsm.com/index/health-insurance-help/faqs/topics/buying-insurance/family-size-impact-cost.html), the more people on an individuals healh plan the more expensive. It is unclear, with this data, what the individual's health plan is. It ould be a family plan, which would explain the increase in cost as the number of children goes up."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the goal of this analysis was to analyze the individual impacts of each factor on the cost of medical insurance of people in the Unites States to make it possible for someone looking to sell insurance to develop competitive salaries while maximising their profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was discovered that the overall health of an individual determined by the bmi, the age and the smoker status of that person contributes greatly to an increase or decrease of insurance cost. The healthier the person is the, the less expensive insurance is. Also, as the number of children goes up, the cost of health insurance increases also.\n",
    "\n",
    "There was an unexpected result as to medical insurance cost when it came to the sex of the individual however. In fact, it was expected to be that the women would pay more health insurance than the man, but it turned out to be the opposite. It was determined that this unexpected result was due to the fact that the dataset was not really representative of hte US population\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the results are all analysed individually, it is possible to go further and to use some machine learning techniques such as multiple linear regression to analyse the effect of combining various factors to the medical_insurance cost. This way, it will be possible to predict the cost of a certain individual with x number of children and living in a region y."
